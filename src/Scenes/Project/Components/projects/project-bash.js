        <p>
        I really...really...really like writing Bash scripts. They're a huge part of my work for monitoring Laravel Queue Workers, Websocket servers or checking commits are written properly.       
        </p>
        <p>The snippet below was used as a Git Hook so we could be sure all commits were prefixed with a keyword so we knew what the commit was doing. Both pluaral and singular keywords were accepted. This meant
          we could use the commit history as our own changelog! 
        </p>

            { `#!/bin/sh
  shopt -s nocasematch  # Case insensitive matching
  shopt -s extglob
  
  RED='\\033[0;31m'
  GREEN='\\033[0;32m'
